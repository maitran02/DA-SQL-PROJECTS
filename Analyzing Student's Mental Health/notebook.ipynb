A Japanese international university surveyed its students in 2018 and published a study the following year that was approved by several ethical and regulatory boards.\n","\n","The study found that international students have a higher risk of mental health difficulties than the general population. Explore the `students` data using PostgreSQL to find out if this is true and see if the length of stay is a contributing factor.\n","\n","Here is a data description of the columns you may find
